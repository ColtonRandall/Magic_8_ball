### Import random and time to randomise responses after a 2-second 'thinking' delay. 
### Import sys to call on a system exit at the end of the program.
import random
import time
import sys
### Print one of 20 responeses, allow user to ask another question or quit.

             'My signs point to YES (I hope it\'s a celebration!)', 'I\'m very doubtful', 'Without a doubt!', 'Yes.', 'Oui (Yes)', 'I would say so']
### Ask the user for their name.
name = input('Welcome to the Magic 8 Ball! (8)' '\n' '\n' 'What is your name?: ')
### Prompt the user for a question
input('\n''Hello ' + name + ' , what is your question?: ' )

### Insert a time delay to mimic a fortune-teller processing the response.
time.sleep(2)
### Space out answers for a cleaner interface with newlines \n and empty strings (). 
print()
### random.choice(mylist) to return a random element from the responses list.
